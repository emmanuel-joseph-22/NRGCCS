        <p class="text-lg mt-2 mb-4 text-justify">
            My friends and I decided to have a new kind of adventure during the summer break last year. 
            We thought that hiking was fun. It could connect us with the environment. 
            We formed our hiking group of eight members. 
            Then we got ready with our baggage for clothes, first aid kits, food packs, tent, map, flashlight, and extra batteries. 
            We travelled to Mount Maculot by the countryside. 
            Fresh air and the beauty of nature welcomed us when we arrived at the place. We at once fell in love with the view around us. 
            We then went our way up to the mountain top. 
            We were soon able to have a view of the beautiful landscape. 
            However, one of us tripped and almost fell on a cliff, So, we decided to set our tents to have some rest. We shared our ideas about the experience over dinner. 
            We thought that hiking does not only give memorable experience but also energizes our soul.
